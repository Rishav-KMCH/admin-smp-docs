Admins manage permissions and player conduct to keep the server running smoothly.

- We may approve or deny requests at our discretion.
- You may not always receive a reason for a declined request — but decisions are made fairly.
- **Please don’t message or spam the VIPs** asking for favors or permissions.
- Our goal is to make sure the server stays fun and fair for everyone.

Thanks for understanding.
