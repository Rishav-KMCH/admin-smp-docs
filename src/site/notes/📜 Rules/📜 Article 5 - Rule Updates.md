Admin SMP rules may change over time as the server evolves.

- Rules can be updated without prior notice.
- By playing on the server, you agree to follow the current version of the rules.
- We recommend checking this documentation occasionally to stay updated.
- We also recommend checking the `Updated` date and time in the articles.

Admins make final decisions when it comes to rule enforcement. If something changes, we’ll do our best to keep things clear — but flexibility is key.
