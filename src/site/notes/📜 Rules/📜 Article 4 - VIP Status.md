VIPs are trusted players who have earned extended permissions â€” including **infinite operative access**.

To become a VIP:

- Collect **15,000 iron**, the in-server currency.
- Demonstrate consistent, responsible behavior on the server.
- Stay active and contribute positively to the community.

VIPs are expected to set a good example. Misusing the role may result in removal of VIP status.
