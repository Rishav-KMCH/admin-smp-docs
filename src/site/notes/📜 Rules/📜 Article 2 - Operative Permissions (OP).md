Unlike some other servers, **Admin SMP does allow players to request admin-level permissions** — but only under certain conditions.

- To request permissions, contact an admin first.
- If your request is considered, you’ll be given an **Approval ID**.
- Use this command to submit your request:    ```
```
/w AdminSMP [Approval ID]
```
- All OP usage is logged and should be used responsibly.

Please note: **If your request is declined, that’s final.** Arguing won’t help.
